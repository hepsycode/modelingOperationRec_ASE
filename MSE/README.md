# Modeling System Environment (MSE)

This work validated the proposed approach on an MSE based on Eclipse and Sirius plugins: the HEPSYCODE project. To collect the traces we use Modeling Events Recorder (MER), an Eclipse plugin that interacts with Sirius-based graphical editors for EMF-based models and records users’ modeling event logs.

#### OVERVIEW
HEPSYCODE (HW/SW CO-DEsign of HEterogeneous Parallel dedicated SYstems) is a prototypal tool to improve the design time of embedded applications. It is based on a System-Level methodology for HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Parallel Dedicated Systems. The whole framework drives the designer from an Electronic System-Level (ESL) behavioral model, with related NF requirements, including real-time and mixed-criticality ones, to the final HW/SW implementation, considering specific HW technologies, scheduling policies and Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms. The system behavior modeling language introduced in HEPSYCODE, named HML (HEPSY Modeling Language), is based on the Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) Model of Computation (MoC). It allows modeling the behavior of the system as a network of processes communicating through unidirectional synchronous channels. By means of HML it is possible to specify the System Behavior Model (SBM), an executable model of the system behavior, a set of Non Functional Constraints (NFC) and a set of Reference Inputs (RI) to be used for simulation-based activities. Through the execution of different steps, including a system-level Design Space Exploration (DSE) approach that allows the related co-design methodology to suggest an HW/SW partitioning of the application specification and a mapping of the partitioned entities onto an automatically defined heterogeneous multi-processor architecture, it is possible to proceed with system implementation.

HEPSYCODE uses Eclipse MDE technologies, SystemC custom simulator implementation and an evolutionary genetic algorithm for partitioning activities, all integrated into an automatic framework that drive the designer from first input to final solution.

This repository contains the HEPSYCODE framework, which consists of a set of

- Reference libraries
- Scripts and makefiles
- Eclipse plugins 
- XML data exchange files
- SystemC files (part of the HEPSYM simulator)
- HW/SW Partitioning And Mapping (PAM) tool
 
#### INSTALLATION
 1. Download Eclipse Modelling Tool: [https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/)
 2. Cloning this repository
 3. Import in Eclipse HEPSYCODE projects present in the folder and run a separate Eclipse application to run and debug HEPSYCODE plug-in
 4. Install Systemc library (it is recommended version 2.3.3)
 5. Go to /home/.bashrc and insert the path of Systemc (folder lib-linux and include) the names of the variable must be SYSTEMCPATHLIB and SYSTEMCPATHINCLUDE for example:
    - export SYSTEMCPATHLIB=/usr/local/systemc-2.3.3/lib-linux64
    - export SYSTEMCPATHINCLUDE=/usr/local/systemc-2.3.3/include
    - Alternative: launch settings.sh script
 6. Try and enjoy the HEPSYCODE Tool!!!

#### SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

### Getting Started Guidelines
To get started with HEPSYCODE, you can:

 1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
 2. Import the plugin projects in the MSE directory in Eclipse.
 3. Use the HEPSYCODE Sirius-based tool to create and edit your HEPSYCODE models.
 4. Generate code from your HEPSYCODE models using the HEPSYCODE M2M XText transformation code.
 5. Simulate your HEPSYCODE models using the HEPSYCODE HEPSIM2 simulator. Examples are available in the HEPSYCODE-Workbench folder.
