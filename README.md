# Towards Synthetic Trace Generation of Modeling Operations using In-Context Learning Approach

This repository presents our proposed approach and the corresponding replication package. The core concept involves integrating a Modeling Event Recorder (MER) framework within a Modeling System Environment (MSE). This framework captures and traces designer activities and modeling steps. Subsequently, it injects these events into Intelligent Modeling Assistants (IMAs), enabling the generation of personalized suggestions for modeling actions most relevant to each designer. The integration path is shown in the Figure below.
